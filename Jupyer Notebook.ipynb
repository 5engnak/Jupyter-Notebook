    "| Data Science Tool | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Python | A general-purpose programming language that is widely used in data science due to its large and comprehensive ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. |\n",
    "| R | A programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is particularly well-suited for data analysis and visualization. |\n",
    "| SQL | A standard language for accessing and manipulating data in relational databases. SQL is essential for working with large datasets that are stored in databases. |\n",
    "| Hadoop | An open-source software framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. Hadoop is well-suited for working with datasets that are too large to fit on a single machine. |\n",
    "| Spark | A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark can be used for both batch and stream processing, and it is well-suited for working with a variety of data sources. |\n",
    "| TensorFlow | An open-source software library for machine learning. TensorFlow is widely used for building and training deep learning models. |\n",
    "| PyTorch | An open-source machine learning framework based on the Torch library. PyTorch is well-suited for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. |\n",
    "| scikit-learn | A Python library for machine learning. scikit-learn provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. |\n",
    "| Matplotlib | A Python library for data visualization. Matplotlib provides a wide range of plotting functions for creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations. |\n",
    "| Tableau | A data visualization software application. Tableau is well-suited for creating interactive data visualizations that can be easily shared with others. |\n",
    "| Jupyter Notebook | A web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter notebooks are a popular tool for data science because they allow you to combine code, data, and prose in a single document. |\n",
    "| BigQuery | A fully-managed, petabyte-scale analytics data warehouse that enables fast, easy, and cost-effective analysis of large datasets. |\n",
    "| Redshift | A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse that can be used for storing and analyzing large datasets. |\n",
    "| Snowflake | A cloud-based data warehouse that can be used for storing and analyzing large datasets. |\n",
    "| Google Cloud Dataproc | A fully-managed Hadoop and Spark service that makes it easy to run large-scale data processing jobs on Google Cloud Platform. |\n",
    "| Amazon EMR | A managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy to run large-scale data processing jobs on Amazon Web Services. |\n",
    "| Microsoft Azure HDInsight | A managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy to run large-scale data processing jobs on Microsoft Azure. |\n"
